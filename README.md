**Medieval Styled Word Guess Game**

 This is a fun Medieval Times themed hangman or word guessing
 game. The object is to guess the word presented without running
 out of guesses. If you do guess the word, you will advance to
 the next level. After advancing you will also earn more guesses.
 The words are all themed from the Medieval Times era, so think castles,
 knights and the such.

 There are only for levels for now. Each level shows a new background 
 picture of a real existing castle. There are over 20 words that are 
 randomly picked from. This list of course is static but could easily be 
 pulled from a database using AJAX or from a service API. The logic is 
 simple and everthing in the game is made using a single object with
 procederal starting code. Jquery is only used for calling the bootstrap 
 components that require it, everything else is pure JS. 

 I created this project to show how javascript can be used 
 to create a fun, challenging yet simple game. like modal dialog boxes, the grid, navbars and a handful of other
 components. I also took advantage of using a Java Script object 
 to create a GAME object.
